# Startup Validation

Cohort would rather not start than run a retention model it can't execute safely. Everything
on this page is checked when the host starts, before any row is touched. A failure names the
entity and the problem.

## Annotations and identity

- Every retained entity has a `[RetentionEntityId]`. Missing, empty, malformed and duplicate
  identities are rejected.
- An entity can't be both `[Retain]` and `[ExemptFromRetention]`.
- Each convention marker attribute (`[RetentionRecordId]`, `[RetentionTenant]`,
  `[RetentionSoftDelete]`, `[RetentionDeletedAt]`, `[RetentionAnonymisedAt]`) appears on at
  most one property.
- `[RetentionTenantless]` isn't combined with a tenant property. Otherwise the tenant property
  would win and the marker would be silently ignored.

## Rules and capabilities

- The union of strategies each category declares in `GetCapabilities` is checked against every
  entity in it. For example, an entity that may be anonymised needs an `AnonymisedAt` marker,
  and one that may be soft-deleted needs a soft-delete flag.
- At run time, a rule whose strategy wasn't declared is rejected.
- `RetentionRule` rejects a negative `Period` or `LegalMin`, which would compute a future
  cutoff and sweep everything.
- `[AnonymiseWith]` factories are registered exactly once as `IAnonymiseValueFactory`.
- `[ErasureSubject(kind)]` kinds aren't blank, every column of one kind holds the same CLR
  type across the model, and each marked property maps to a physical column with a
  compatible provider type.

## Mapping shapes

Cohort mutates one independently owned table per retained entity, and won't guess which
columns or rows belong to it. So these are rejected:

- retained owned types
- entities sharing a table with another EF type
- entities split across multiple tables
- entities in an EF inheritance hierarchy (TPH, TPT or TPC), because sweep SQL targets the
  table without a discriminator

## Columns

- Anchor, `DeletedAt` and `AnonymisedAt` columns map to `timestamp with time zone`
  (`timestamptz` and precision variants are fine). Cohort compares and writes retention
  timestamps as UTC instants, and a naive `timestamp without time zone` column silently drifts
  with the session time zone.
- Tenant, anchor, soft-delete, deleted-at and anonymised-at properties don't use EF value
  converters. Cohort filters and writes those columns in SQL, where a converter wouldn't
  apply.
- A record ID that isn't the primary key is unique through an alternate key or an unfiltered
  unique index. A filtered index doesn't make it unique.
- Record-ID types whose text form depends on session settings are rejected. See
  [Identities](/reference/schema#identities).

## Foreign keys

- No `ON DELETE CASCADE` foreign key leads from a purgeable retained entity into another
  retained entity. A cascade would bypass the dependent's retention window, holds and audit
  trail.
- No cascade leads from a purgeable retained entity back into a retained type, including
  itself through a self-reference.
- Retained entities can't form a foreign-key cycle. Cohort sweeps dependents before their
  principals, so it needs an order.

## Database

- The connection is PostgreSQL.
- The installed Cohort schema has the required columns, keys, unique indexes and `CHECK`
  constraints. See [Readiness](/reference/schema#readiness).
- [Options](/reference/configuration) are in range.
