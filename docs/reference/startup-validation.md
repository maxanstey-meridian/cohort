# Startup Validation

Cohort would rather not start than run a retention model it can't execute safely. Everything
on this page is checked when the host starts, before any row is touched. A failure names the
entity and the problem.

## Required services

- An `IRetentionExecutionScope` is registered. Cohort runs each scope's work through it, so a
  host's tenant isolation covers Cohort's own work. Hosts without
  tenant isolation register `RetentionExecutionScope.Unisolated`. Without either, the host
  fails to start, and a host that skips startup validation fails on its first Cohort call. See
  [Tenant Isolation](/guides/tenant-isolation).

## Annotations and identity

- Every retained entity has a `[RetentionEntityId]`. Missing, empty, malformed and duplicate
  identities are rejected.
- An entity can't be both `[Retain]` and `[ExemptFromRetention]`.
- Each convention marker attribute (`[RetentionRecordId]`, `[RetentionTenant]`,
  `[RetentionSoftDelete]`, `[RetentionDeletedAt]`, `[RetentionAnonymisedAt]`) appears on at
  most one property.
- `[RetentionTenantless]` isn't combined with a tenant property. Otherwise the tenant property
  would win and the marker would be silently ignored.

## Row handlers

- Every [row handler](/guides/row-handlers) carries a `[RowHandlerId]` holding a non-empty
  UUID, and no two handlers of one entity share an id. `AddRowHandler` refuses either problem
  when it's called, naming the handler.
- Every `IRetentionHandler<T>` service is registered once, through `AddRowHandler`, as
  scoped. A handler registered any other way is refused and named.

## Rules and capabilities

- The union of strategies each category declares in `GetCapabilities` is checked against every
  entity in it. For example, an entity that may be anonymised needs an `AnonymisedAt` marker,
  and one that may be soft-deleted needs a soft-delete flag.
- At run time, a rule whose strategy wasn't declared is rejected.
- `RetentionPeriod` rejects a negative part, which would compute a future cutoff and sweep
  everything.
- `TimeZone` must name a time zone the host knows.
- `[AnonymiseWith]` factories are registered exactly once as `IAnonymiseValueFactory`.
- `[ErasureSubject(kind)]` kinds aren't blank, every column of one kind holds the same CLR
  type across the model, and each marked property maps to a physical column with a
  compatible provider type.

## Mapping shapes

Cohort mutates one independently owned table per retained entity, and won't guess which
columns or rows belong to it. So these are rejected:

- retained owned types
- entities sharing a table with another EF type
- entities split across multiple tables
- entities in an EF inheritance hierarchy (TPH, TPT or TPC), because sweep SQL targets the
  table without a discriminator

## Columns

- Anchor, `DeletedAt` and `AnonymisedAt` columns map to `timestamp with time zone`
  (`timestamptz` and precision variants are fine). Cohort compares and writes retention
  timestamps as UTC instants, and a naive `timestamp without time zone` column silently drifts
  with the session time zone.
- Tenant, anchor, soft-delete, deleted-at and anonymised-at properties don't use EF value
  converters. Cohort filters and writes those columns in SQL, where a converter wouldn't
  apply.
- A record ID that isn't the primary key is unique through an alternate key or an unfiltered
  unique index. A filtered index doesn't make it unique.
- Record-ID types whose text form depends on session settings are rejected. See
  [Identities](/reference/schema#identities).
- Each retained table and its record-ID column exist in the database.
- Each anonymised column can take what Cohort writes to it, checked against the database
  catalog: the column exists and the model's store type can be assigned to its type without
  an explicit cast; an `EmptyString` or `FixedLiteral` value, after the value converter, is
  valid input for both types (length, type and domain `CHECK` included); `Null` doesn't go
  into a column the database declares `NOT NULL`, directly or through nested domains; a value
  every row shares (`EmptyString`, `FixedLiteral`, a `Static` factory) isn't written to a
  column in the key of an unfiltered unique index whose key lacks the record ID; a literal
  isn't written to a foreign-key column; and no anonymised column is referenced by a foreign
  key. See [Anonymisation](/guides/anonymisation).
- No foreign key references a column an update strategy always writes: the soft-delete flag
  and deleted-at of an entity that may be soft-deleted, or the anonymised-at marker of one
  that may be anonymised. Changing a referenced key is either refused while a row references
  it or silently rewrites the referencing rows.

## Foreign keys

- No `ON DELETE CASCADE` foreign key leads from a purgeable retained entity into another
  retained entity. A cascade would bypass the dependent's retention window, holds and audit
  trail.
- No cascade leads from a purgeable retained entity back into a retained type, including
  itself through a self-reference.
- Retained entities can't form a foreign-key cycle. Cohort sweeps dependents before their
  principals, so it needs an order.
- `RESTRICT` and `NO ACTION` dependents are expected and aren't refused. A purge leaves a row
  they still reference in place and reports it in `BlockedCount`; the next run tries it
  again. A child that never expires, or whose category can't purge, keeps its parent's
  `BlockedCount` from ever shrinking.

## Database

- The connection is PostgreSQL, version 16 or later.
- The installed Cohort schema has the required columns, keys, unique indexes and `CHECK`
  constraints, and no required column Cohort doesn't write. See
  [Readiness](/reference/schema#readiness).
- No active hold names a `[RetentionEntityId]` that no retained entity in the model declares
  any more. Such a hold would never match its row again, so the row would lose its protection
  without an error. See [Changed entity identities](/reference/schema#changed-entity-identities).
- [Options](/reference/configuration) are in range.
